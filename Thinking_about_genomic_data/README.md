# Thinking about genomic data

This directory contains a variety of common file types used to handle genomic data, with a bias towards data used in reference-based genome assembly and analysis.

## Getting this repo

If you haven't done so already, you can clone this entire repository to your local computer or cluster.  To do so, move to the directory on your computer/cluster where you'd like to work and type the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/thw17/ASU_Genomics_Workshop_Summer2017
```
This should create a directory called ASU_Genomics_Workshop_Summer2017 containing all of the contents of this repo.


## Data sources

- human_g1k_v37_MT.fasta was generated by extracting the mitochondrial sequence from the 1000 genomes reference (available here: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/) with the command:
```
samtools faidx human_g1k_v37.fasta MT > human_g1k_v37_MT.fasta
```

- The indices for the two fasta sequences were generated with the commands:
```
samtools faidx human_g1k_v37_MT.fasta
samtools faidx toy.fasta
samtools dict human_g1k_v37_MT.fasta -o human_g1k_v37_MT.dict
samtools dict toy.fasta -o toy.dict
```
