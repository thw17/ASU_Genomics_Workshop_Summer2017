This repository contains materials for an ASU genomics workshop/bootcamp organized for the Wilson Sayres lab on June 12 and 13, 2017.  In this repository, there are currently two directories: "Thinking_about_genomic_data"
and "Intro_to_reproducible_genome_assembly."  The former contains materials for
and introductory discussion to thinking about genomic data and a crash course on some of the most common data formats.  The latter contains a hands on tutorial to reference-based genome assembly and variant calling, as well as an introduction to implementing a reproducible pipeline in snakemake.
